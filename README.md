# Missing Person Identification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

This project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to help identify missing persons through image recognition. It takes images of unidentified individuals and compares them to a database of known missing persons to identify possible matches.

## Introduction
This project aims to assist law enforcement and other agencies in identifying missing persons using machine learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks. The goal is to develop a model that can suggest possible matches based on facial recognition.

## Installation
To set up the project, ensure you have Python and necessary dependencies installed. Clone the repository and install required packages:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd missing-person-cnn
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The system compares unidentified person images against a database of missing persons to suggest potential matches. To run the model on a set of images, use the following command:

```bash
python identify_missing_person.py --input <input-folder> --output <output-file>
```

- `--input`: The folder containing images of unidentified persons.
- `--output`: The file to save potential matches.

## Data Preparation
To train the CNN, you need labeled images of missing persons and unidentified persons. Data should be organized in the following structure:

```
data/
├── missing_persons/
│   ├── person1.jpg
│   ├── person2.jpg
│   └── ...
└── unidentified/
    ├── person1.jpg
    ├── person2.jpg
    └── ...
```

## Model Architecture
The CNN architecture is designed for facial recognition, with several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. The details are provided in `model.py`.

## Training
To train the model, use the following command:

```bash
python train_model.py --epochs 10 --batch-size 32
```

- `--epochs`: Number of epochs for training.
- `--batch-size`: Batch size for training.

Ensure the dataset is adequately balanced and normalized for optimal results.

## Ethical Considerations
This project deals with sensitive information. Ensure compliance with privacy laws and obtain necessary permissions before using any data. Respect the privacy and dignity of missing persons and their families. This project is intended to support law enforcement agencies and should not be used for unauthorized surveillance or other unethical activities.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to improve the model and expand the dataset. Please submit pull requests with a description of your changes. Ensure your code adheres to established coding standards.

I hope this provides a comprehensive guide for creating a README for a missing person identification project using CNNs. If you have any additional questions or specific details you'd like me to focus on, I'm here to help.
